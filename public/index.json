I would access my local url and see the server. I would create a branch and make the necessary changes. Review the changes in my locale. Repeat steps 3 and 4 as many times as necessary. Create a commit with the changes and push them to origin on Github. Create a Pull Request. It runs a GHA? of codeball.ai which parses the code and gives you a trust factor. Merge the PR? to main. With each new commit in main, run another GHA that builds the Hugo static files. Basically it runs hugo which generates the public folder. Once the files are generated, they are published to Github Pages with another GHA. This flow actually works well but has several disadvantages. You can\u0026rsquo;t keep the repository private if you want to use Github Pages, you have a lot of codebase and generated files in the same repository, etc.\nWith the new flow, you could have the repository with the static files public, and the original one, which does the build of the web, private (although this is not my case).\nNew workflow In this new workflow we are going to have two repositories, one that is like the old one, where all the Hugo codebase is, and another one where just the web statics will be.\nAnd really, once the changes are implemented, the flow doesn\u0026rsquo;t change much either. The last step of the old flow is where we make changes: now we generate the public folder in the original repository, but we don\u0026rsquo;t publish it. Now it is uploaded to the new repository with a GHA. Once this information is uploaded to the new repository, the publication of the static website is executed.\nThis graphic may explain the flow a little bit, although I\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;s poorly defined because I never learned sequential diagrams 😅: hugo repopr createdagainst mainGithub Actionsorigin html repocodeball.iapr mergedin maingenerate html contentpush contentreview prpublish in website This is useful if for example we want to hide the original reposition. In my case, I\u0026rsquo;m using codeball.ai and it\u0026rsquo;s only free for the public repos, so for now, I\u0026rsquo;ll keep both repos public, but who knows.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all, thank you very much for reading!\n","permalink":"https://jesusfj710.github.io/blog/transforming-the-structure-of-the-web-repos/","summary":"Hello everyone!\nThe other day I was busy going through some information about Hugo, Github Actions, etc and decided to change the way the website works because it seemed like the right thing to do.\nThe before When I first published the website, everything was contained in a single repository.\nIn this repository I had everything related to Hugo, and the workflow went something like this:\nI started the Hugo server on my local, running hugo serve.","tags":["Hugo","Github","Github Actions","codabal.ai","Github Pages"],"title":"Transforming the structure of the web repos"},{"content":"Hello!\nI recently changed my workflow to work with the web, and to show the details, I wanted to insert a graphic. I was using Excalidraw, and the advantage is that you can export it as SVG? .\nLimitations encountered 🚧 When I tried to import the SVG directly into the content of the entry, I ran into some problems. More than problems, they were limitations such as the following:\nThe need to define a background. Limited to a single colour profile. You cannot have one for light mode and one for dark mode. Cannot modify styles, as it was inserted as an \u0026lt;img\u0026gt; tag, which does not support inherited styles (useful info available here). Creating the shortcode 🥾 With the information from the last point in the previous section, we can create our own shortcode. So I decided to apply that and extend the behaviour a bit more. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example using the following snippet:\n{{\u0026lt; svg \u0026#34;static/images/blog/004/example.svg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} The first limitation I see in my implementation is the width, which in this example looks clearly huge and is not necessary, so I need to make the width an optional parameter.\nWe moved on from this shortcode that did not allow to set the width (it was predefined as 100% in the styles):\n{{$svg := .Get 0}} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;svg-fill-background\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{ $svg | readFile | safeHTML }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; To the next one, where we can optionally indicate the percentage width, and the change can be seen below (we could extend this to more properties, but it\u0026rsquo;s not necessary for now):\n{{$svg := .Get 0}} {{$width := .Get 1 | default \u0026#34;100%\u0026#34;}} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;svg-fill-background\u0026#34; style=\u0026#34;width: {{$width}}; margin: 0 auto\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{ $svg | readFile | safeHTML }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{\u0026lt; svg \u0026#34;static/images/blog/004/example.svg\u0026#34; \u0026#34;40%\u0026#34;\u0026gt;}} Light mode and dark mode 🌗 If you switch the web between the two modes, you can see how the graphic changes colour. It actually works as a single SVG graphic that is coloured with CSS? .\nbody .svg-fill-background svg { background: var(--code-bg); max-width: 100%; height: 100%; path { stroke: var(--primary) } text { fill: var(--content) } } You can check how the changes have turned out in the PR I prepared in my Github repository.\nCheers!\n","permalink":"https://jesusfj710.github.io/blog/creating-a-shortcode-to-insert-svg-in-hugo/","summary":"Hello!\nI recently changed my workflow to work with the web, and to show the details, I wanted to insert a graphic.
