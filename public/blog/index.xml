      <description>Good afternoon, everyone!
The other day, I shared on my LinkedIn that I was going to start contributing to FOSS? projects because of the high impact these tools have on my work.
The truth is, even a small contribution can help a project cover the cost of a domain or other expenses.
In the context of SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) and the QA (Quality Assurance) department in IT companies, I believe we rely heavily on these tools, but we usually don&amp;rsquo;t give much back.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good afternoon, everyone!</p>
<p>The other day, I shared on my LinkedIn that I was going to start contributing to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">

<abbr title="Software libre y de c√≥digo abierto">FOSS<sup>?</sup></abbr>
</a> projects because of the high impact these tools have on my work.</p>
<p>The truth is, even a small contribution can help a project cover the cost of a domain or other expenses.</p>
<p>In the context of SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) and the QA (Quality Assurance) department in IT companies, I believe we rely heavily on these tools, but we usually don&rsquo;t give much back. I understand that for personal projects that we abandon after a few days, we may not consider contributing monetarily (although that&rsquo;s not the only way), but considering the impact and ease they provide us, I think it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Lately, all of this has been on my mind, and talking to colleagues at work, I feel that I&rsquo;m not alone in this opinion. The triggering event that made me take the step forward was when the author of <a href="https://softwaretestingweekly.com">Software Testing Weekly</a> newsletter (which I highly recommend) mentioned a couple of weeks ago that the last original maintainer of Cucumber had been laid off and would no longer work on that project apparently (more info <a href="https://softwaretestingweekly.com/issues/166">here</a> and <a href="https://mattwynne.net/new-beginning">here</a>).</p>
<p>Cucumber is a tool we use constantly every day in the QA team, and without it, we could say that many of the frameworks we use would also be affected.</p>
<p>Therefore, I decided to start contributing to Cucumber and Webdriver.io because they are extensive projects, highly flexible, and used by many companies.</p>
<p>I invite all of you to reflect on this and try, as much as possible, to contribute to these types of projects because in the end, everything has an impact on other projects that private companies will ultimately use without giving credit or returning some of the work to the community. ü•∫</p>
<p>Thank you and take care!</p>

      <description>This is the first post on my website.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Update 04/24/2023</strong> ‚ö†Ô∏è: After checking that the charlola theme was actually (without having correctly attributed it) a fork of <code>hugo-PaperMod</code> I decided to change it and update the repository license.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a long time, I have finally decided to make a website where I can have my own portfolio (in the future) as well as uploading some articles about things I find interesting.</p>
<p>The aim is no other than forcing myself to document and explain how I do things and thus be able to share everything.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-web">Building the web</h2>
<p>The website is built with <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> which uses <a href="http://go.dev">Go</a> <em>aka Golang</em> underneath.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super convenient to be able to write things directly in <em>markdown</em>, upload them to your Github repository, have a Github <em>workflow</em> do the <em>build</em> of the site and publish it directly in less than a minute.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the progress of the project in the <a href="https://github.com/jesusfj710/jesusfj710.github.io">github repository</a>.</p>
<p>A big thanks to <a href="https://www.heycharlola.com/">charlola</a> for his template and instructions on the Hugo theme.</p>
